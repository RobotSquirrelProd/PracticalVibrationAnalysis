## Introduction

Computation tools for looking at real-world signals for [applied vibration analysis](https://robotsquirrelproductions.com/applied-vibration-analysis/):

As of this writing, the package is a work-in-progress and heavily in development. Structure and syntax will likely change prior to a formal release.

If you do scare up the courage to install this and try commands, I would love your feedback, please log issues and concerns here in the GitHub repository.

## Repository layout

- `python/vibration_analysis/`: Maintained Python package source.
- `python/tests/`: Primary automated test suite.
- `python/tests/legacy/`: Legacy tests that exercise older modules and hardware integrations.
- `python/tests/data/`: Test fixture data files used by test modules.
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory notebooks and test harness notebooks.
- `scripts/`: Local helper scripts and launchers.
- `docs/architecture/`: Architecture and UML artifacts.
- `docs/figures/`: Generated figures and plot exports.

## Installation

In this early stage I clone the repository to a local folder and then:

-   Create and activate the dev environment:

    `virtualenv dev_env`

    `source dev_env/bin/activate`

-   Navigate to the local folder with the cloned contents from Github:

    `cd “C:\Local Documents\Github\AppliedVibrationAnalysis”`

-   Use `pip` to install the package (note the ‘`.`’ at the end):

    `pip install -e .`

I verified these instructions in Windows 11, but it should be similar for other operating systems.

## Quick Examples

This section has some examples to get you startedd.

### Timebase plot

A timebase plot shows an amplitude versus time waveform in a rectangular grid for one data series. This plot format can be thought of as a high-resolution trend with 1000s of points over a few hundred milliseconds. 

The repo includes a [hello world notebook](notebooks/AppliedVibrationAnalysis%20HelloWorld.ipynb) with more examples. But to get started follow these 3 steps to get the plot up:

-   Load the libraries:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 300
import numpy as np
import math
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from scipy import signal
import matplotlib
from appvib import ClSigFeatures
	
```	
	
-   Synthesize the signal:


```
d_fs_even = 2048
i_ns = (d_fs_even*2)`
d_freq_sig = 10./(float(i_ns)/d_fs_even)
print('Signal frequency, hertz: ' + '%0.10f' % d_freq_sig)
d_time_ext = np.linspace(0,(i_ns-1),i_ns)/float(d_fs_even)
np_d_test_even = np.sin(2 * math.pi * d_freq_sig * d_time_ext )
```
	
-   Create the plot starting with defining the data features:

```
ClSigEven = ClSigFeatures(np_d_test_even, d_fs_even,
    dt_timestamp=datetime.fromisoformat('2020-01-01T00:00:00-00:00'))
ClSigEven.str_plot_desc = "Sinusoid"
ClSigEven.str_machine_name_set("Simulated Data", idx=0)
ClSigEven.str_eu_set("g's",idx=0)

```

```
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [8, 4.5]
lst_sig_even = ClSigEven.plt_sigs()
lst_sig_even.savefig('HelloWorld_Sinusoid.pdf')
```
	
The code should produce a plot like this:
